# On the Preferences of Quality Indicators for Multi-Objective Search Algorithms in Search-Based Software Engineering

## Abstract
Multi-Objective Search Algorithms (MOSAs) have been applied to solve diverse Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) problems. In most cases, SBSE users select one or more commonly used MOSAs (for instance, Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)) to solve their search problems, without any justification (i.e., not supported by any evidence) on why those particular MOSAs are selected. However, when working with a specific multi-objective SBSE problem, users typically know what kind(s) of qualities they are looking for in solutions. Such qualities are represented by one or more Quality Indicators (QIs), which are often employed to assess various MOSAs to select the best MOSA. However, users usually have limited time budgets, which prevents them from executing multiple MOSAs and consequently selecting the best MOSA in the end. Therefore, for such users, it is highly preferred to select only one MOSA since the beginning. To this end, in this paper, we aim to assist SBSE users in finding appropriate MOSAs for their experiments, given their choices of QIs or quality aspects (e.g., Convergence, Uniformity).
To achieve this aim, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation with 18 search problems from a set of real-world, industrial, and open-source case studies, to study preferences among commonly used QIs and MOSAs in SBSE. We observe that each QI has its own specific most-preferred MOSA and vice versa; NSGA-II and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) are the most preferred MOSAs by QIs; no QI is the most preferred by all the MOSAs; the preferences between QIs and MOSAs vary across the search problems; QIs covering the same quality aspect(s) do not necessarily have the same preference for MOSAs. Based on our results, we provide discussions and guidelines for SBSE users to select appropriate MOSAs based on experimental evidence.
